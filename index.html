            <p>Trinity College Botanic Garden, located in Dartry, Dublin, D06W226 is a teaching and research facility
                for the Trinity College Botany Department. It is home to a living collection of approximately 4,000
                species, and also houses the Irish Threatened Plant Seed Bank. The majority of the gardens are
                outside with the only indoor areas being inside the glasshouses so wear something warm or bring a
                jacket on colder days. Please note that most of the surfaces are a mixture of gravel and grass and
                may be more difficult to traverse for visitors with limited mobility. We are currently working to make
                the gardens and glasshouses easily accessible to everyone.</p>

                 <p>The gardenâ€™s origins date back over 330 years to its inception in 1687 as a physic garden for the teaching of medicine at Trinity College. Since then it has changed location twice, and has been here in Dartry, Dublin 6 since 1967. Today, the garden serves as a teaching and research facility for the Trinity College Botany Department. It is home to a living collection of approximately 4000 species, and also houses the Irish Threatened Plant Seedbank.

        <h2>Sensory Trail</h2>
        
             <p>The Trinity College Botanic Garden Sensory Trail was the idea of Heather McLean. Her internship was sponsored by the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/disability/" target="_blank" rel="nonopener">Trinity Disability Service </a>in a new and exciting collaboration between Trinity Botanic Garden and Trinity Disability Service to create a special sensory map of the gardens as part of the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/disability/services/tcdsense.php" target="_blank" rel="nonopener"> TCD Sense - The Trinity Sensory Processing Project</a>. Heather has just completed her Botany degree at Trinity.

              The gardens are available to visit all year round, except during the Christmas holiday period - opening hours are listed below. Occasionally members of the public are invited in for events, such as Culture Night, and details of these can be found on the Calendar of Events page. Getting to the gardens is easy with a leap card, the 140 bus is every ten minutes from outside Trinity towards Rathmines. Stay on the bus until the very last stop and the gardens are a three minute walk away. Alternatively, you can take the green line Luas to Cowper and the gardens are a ten minute walk from there. Watch the Way Finder Video to learn how to get there. Catering facilities are not available at this location so bring your own food and drink. Please take all rubbish away with you. The The Walled Garden and the glass houses are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 4pm. The West and South Arboretums are available 24/7 (access is via Trinity Halls entrance only); however, please note that any planned activities there must be notified in advance to Dr Steve Waldren, Curator, swaldren@tcd.ie.

                      <strong>Sensory Classification: Quiet Space.</strong> The Botanic Garden is a quiet and peaceful space for the college community to enjoy the nature and an incredible collection of plants. During term time some areas may be slightly busy when they are being used for teaching, but the majority of the time they are quiet and peaceful. Visitors are welcome to walk the grounds, explore the glasshouses, or rest, read and relax with nature. Detailed sensory information is included in the sensory trail of the gardens.

                                        lavender. Lavender smells the strongest when it is flowering in spring and summer. Are there any
                                        flowers on the lavender plant when you visit? Research has found that the smell of lavender can
                                        have calming effects on humans and other animals and has also been found to reduce anxiety and
                                        decrease stress. How are you feeling today? Do you feel any different after smelling lavender for a
                                        moment or two? If you like the smell, break a small sprig off the lavender and carry it round with you
                                        while you explore the gardens.</p>

                                        and watch honey bees crawling in and out their hive and listen to the faint buzzing. These are one of
                                        the main pollinators for the gardens and the reason the trees in the Gardens are so full of fruit every
                                        autumn. Note how you feel when you watch bees. Some people find watching beehives calming and
                                        hypnotic, others feel uncomfortable and nervous. How does watching and listening to the bees
                                        affect you? If you enjoy watching the bees and you are visiting in summer months, look for the tall
                                        plant with pale yellow flowers (meadow rue) by the entrance to the South Arboretum. and you
                                        should find it teeming with white-tailed bumble bees. Take a moment to watch the bees flit from
                                        flower to flower and listen to their gentle buzzing.</p>

                                        and male cones which contain the pollen use different scents to attract and repel pollinators. What
                                        does the house smell like to you on your visit? Carefully (they can be sharp) touch some of the
                                        leaves. Mature leaves are tough, smooth and often very sharp to deter herbivores. Look around and
                                        see if you can spot any cycads growing new leaves. What do they feel like? New leaves on cycads are
                                        feel much softer / velvety. This house can be visited all year but the greenhouse is heated in winter
                                        to protect these tropical trees from the cold, making it the perfect place to visit if the winter blues
                                        have you feeling down. You can visit the heated greenhouse, listen to the rain on the roof, smell the
                                        trees, touch the plants and enjoy some outside time in the warm.</p>

                                        Aloe vera, has been designated to let visitors take a section of leaf from and explore the tactile

                                        ask one of the staff! How does the liquid inside the leaf smell? Some describe it as a savoury smell,
                                        similar to garlic or an onion. Do you like the smell? Many people are aware that the sap inside this
                                        plant can soothe sunburn, but itâ€™s also a very effective moisturiser for dry skin and a historical
                                        treatment for acne. Some people enjoy rubbing Aloe on their hands as a sensory stimulant for touch
                                        and smell. Please note: If you decide to use this as a moisturiser / spot treatment you do so at your
                                        own risk, allergic reactions are possible and if you get aloe vera in your eye it can be very painful! So
                                        approach this sensory station with caution and take care of yourself.</p>

                                        gardens have historically been used to brew different herbal teas. Mulberry tea for example has
                                        properties which reduce inflammation, regulate blood sugar and improve heart health. Tea made
                                        from pine needles is high in vitamins C and A which aid your immune system, eyesight and skin and
                                        hair regeneration. Gingko tea is high in antioxidants and some research shows that tea made from
                                        Gingko trees reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and dementia. Gingko tea may also improve

                                    <p>Throughout history witch hazel has been used as a treatment for many skin conditions such as
                                        stretch marks and acne, due to its exceptional anti-inflammatory properties. Break off a leaf and
                                        sniff it. Some describe it as fresh and lemon scented. Witch hazel concoctions are available to
                                        purchase commercially, however if you are unable to afford it, you can research online how to
                                        forage and prepare acne treatments from witch hazel you have foraged yourself.</p>

                                        ideal space to spend time in during rainy days. One plant in the Irish House, Equisetum hyemale
                                        (horsetail), is a living fossil which evolved tens of millions of years ago. Equisetum has tiny leaves
                                        that are joined at the colourful stripes on the stem. Take a moment and look at how differently
                                        shaped this plant is to many others at the gardens. Most plants have curves created by the stem and
                                        leaf shapes, this plant is linear and vertical. What do the contrasting colours remind you of? Stroke
                                        the stem. Does it feel rough or smooth? Does this plant remind you of any other plants at the
                                        Gardens? You will find tree stump seats in the Long House where you can sit and wait for the storm
                                        to pass while you smell the rain and listen to the sound on the roof.</p>

                                        summer day. If it is warm and dry try lying on the grass under the Black Walnut tree and looking up

                                    <p>In spring and early summer you will find wild garlic growing in the South Arboretum. Search for it in
                                        the spring under the trees near the bluebells. What does the smell remind you of? Garlic contains
                                        Allicin, a sulphur compound, and some find the smell relaxing and, whilst not proven, an old remedy
                                        for insomnia is to put a garlic clove under your pillow as the smell is said to relax people. Why not sit
                                        down on the bench in the corner of the Arboretum while you decide if you like the smell from the
                                        wild garlic or not? When picked at the right time, the entire plant is edible including the leaves,
                                        stalks, bulbs and flowers. Past visitors to the gardens have harvested this and used it in a variety of
                                        recipes including pesto, lasagne, and as a herb in many other recipes. As well as being a sensory
                                        stimulant, eating garlic has other benefits for physical health as it boosts the immune system and
                                        can help reduce high blood pressure and high cholesterol. If you catch the common cold, eating
                                        garlic is thought to hasten the recovery time. Visitors are allowed to collect wild garlic if they wish,
                                        but please note if you decide to consume it you do so at your own risk and it is your responsibility to
                                        ensure that you are not allergic and that it is washed and prepared correctly.</p>

                                        visual and scented stimuli they provide across the seasons. No one will stop you harvesting fruit
                                        from these trees, stewed apples and poached pears are a delicious way to incorporate vitamin C and

                                        there is another plant, commonly known as Babyâ€™s tears. Soleirolia soleirolii is in the nettle family but
                                        it wonâ€™t sting you, it is actually very soft to touch and cushiony to sit on. Can you see any flowers?
                                        This flowers between May and August but the flowers are so tiny you might not be able to see them.
                                        If itâ€™s a nice day, take your shoes off and walk around the Babyâ€™s Tears barefoot. Many people find
                                        walking outside with bare feet is a very grounding experience and soothes anxiety. Part of this is
                                        because when you are walking barefoot outside you watch carefully where you step meaning your
                                        eyes are absorbing a lot of green light waves. Green environments are soothing and research shows
                                        they can induce a reduction in the human heartrate which has a calming influence on the body. In
                                        addition to this, there are pressure points under your feet that connect with the eye nervous system,

                                    <p>In the east of the gardens, near Lizâ€™s bench, you will find instead of grass covering the ground here there is another plant, commonly known as Babyâ€™s tears. Soleirolia soleirolii is in the nettle family but it wonâ€™t sting you, it is actually very soft to touch and cushiony to sit on. Can you see any flowers? This flowers between May and August but the flowers are so tiny you might not be able to see them. 
                                        If itâ€™s a nice day, take your shoes off and walk around the Babyâ€™s Tears barefoot. Many people find walking outside with bare feet is a very grounding experience and soothes anxiety. Part of this is because when you are walking barefoot outside you watch carefully where you step meaning your eyes are absorbing a lot of green light waves. Green environments are soothing and research shows they can induce a reduction in the human heartrate which has a calming influence on the body. In addition to this, there are pressure points under your feet that connect with the eye nervous system, and pressure on these points can ease eyestrain. So sensory information received by walking around barefoot outside might actually improve another of your senses â€“ eyesight.</p>

Some people find watching beehives calming and hypnotic, others feel uncomfortable and nervous. How does watching and listening to the bees affect you? If you enjoy watching the bees and you are visiting in summer months, look for the tall plant with pale yellow flowers (meadow rue) by the entrance to the South Arboretum. and you should find it teeming with white-tailed bumble bees.
